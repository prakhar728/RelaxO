# SubHUB

### A place where subscribing is as easy as a click of a button. We bring Account Abstraction using Relayer servers to reduce the gas fees and improve the overrall UX.


## The problem it solves
SubHUB targets a major of problem faced by EOA users. Approving the transactions and signing messages. Through SubHUB we aim to easen up that process by a massive scale.
The major problems:-
1. **Managing gas fees** - Gas fees has to be managed by one party or the other, and that too with the native token. - This is solved with the use of relayer servers. We make use of Node.js based servers that act as an intermediate between the users and the blockchain. They interact with the blockchain, and smart contract to do the heavy and tedious task and in-fact **Pay for their gas fees**. This improves the UX by a lot, and also attracts more and more users.
2. **Using EOAs** - Having to manage Externally Owned accounts, keep track of seed phrases, private keys etc. - The Accounts are managed through Decentralized identity using Magic SDK. Now, onboarding is as easy as entering an OTP(Quite literally).
3. **Transaction Approval** - Having to approve each and every transaction and sign messages manually. - We bring one time approval, the smart contract takes care of the tokens itself securely, and the subscribers sit back, relax and enjoy their subscriptions.

## Challenges I ran into
I faced many challenges, mostly because this whole Acount Abstraction was very new to me and to understand it required a lot of effort. Unfortunately, Mantle doesn't have many integration supports throughout so it became a barrier again and again but neverthless - the speed and throughput has me invested in building something even better on the chain.
1. **Integrating the Magic SDK was a task** - Trying to get Mantle work with the Magic SDK was a task - I couldn't figure out that they didn't support it.
2. **Building the relayer** - It was still tough to get a local node get up and running, that could interact with the blockchain on the users behalf.
Overrall the hackathon was a really fun experience and I learned a lot about L2 blockchains, specially Mantle and it's working.
